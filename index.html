                        <p>
                            I have studied programming and computer science at Benilde-St.Margaret's for 3 years.
                            I received multiple awards from BSM and have participated in the RoboCup tournament.
                            I was involved with robot automation and remote interfacing on our teams robot.
                            In 2019 my automation code scored more points than BSM had ever received before.

                        <h1>Auto Attendance Bot</h1>
                        <p>
                            In 2020 my school closed down in order to protect families from the COVID-119 Outbreak.
                            Transitioning to an online school environment was awkward, but my attendance bot made it easier to manage.
                            Every morning at 9:00 a.m. my computer would automatically turn on and sign me into my classes

                        <h1>Facebook Car Bot</h1>
                        <p>
                            When I started used car shopping I found how tedious it is to search through Facebook marketplace to find a good deal.
                            Instead of struggling with it, I used Python to automate the process.
                            Using a spreadsheet filled with cars, my Python bot would give each car a score based on year, milage, and price of the car.
                            Then, it would search through hundreds of car listings and try to find cars with a higher score.
                            When a listing had a higher score, it would be added to the spreadsheet for me to check-on later.

                        <h1>Discord Bot</h1>
                        <p>
                            A club at BSM started using Discord as their communication platform when the school was shutdown.
                            With many people in the server it was hard for the leaders to keep up with everything.
                            To fix the problem, I used the Discordpy library to make a bot.
                            The bot's main function was to handle new user information and assign roles but could also be used for server moderation.
